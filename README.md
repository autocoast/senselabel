**SenseLabel** is an open-source, web-based application for annotating remote sensing data. It is designed to assist researchers, analysts, and developers in labelling geospatial data efficiently. The tool supports multiple satellite format and, advanced visualization.

**Live Demo**: [https://senselabel.vercel.app](https://senselabel.vercel.app)

## Features

- **Multi-Layer Editing**: Annotate, visualize, and manage raster layers.
- **Advanced Drawing Tools**: Includes pen, eraser, bucket fill, and gap-drawer tools.
- **Geospatial Analysis**:
  - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
  - Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)
  - K-means clustering for vegetation and land classification.
- **Data Management**: Upload and assign metadata to satellite images.
- **Interoperability**: Supports standard GIS formats like GeoTIFF.
- **Extensibility**: Built with modern frameworks (Nuxt, TailwindCSS) for easy customization.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/autocoast/senselabel.git
cd senselabel

# Install dependencies

```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production Build

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

---

## Configuration

The tool comes pre-configured to support **Sentinel-2** and **Landsat 8** bands. To add support for other satellites, you can perform a global search for the term `SatelliteType` in the codebase. Adjust the relevant files to include configurations for the new satellite bands.  
Additionally adjust the `config/config.ts` file.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Nuxt, TailwindCSS, Vue.js
- **Visualization**: Leaflet, PanZoom
- **Geospatial Processing**: GeoTIFF, ndArray
- **Backend Processing**: Web workers for NDVI, NDWI, k-means clustering
